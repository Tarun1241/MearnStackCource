This is the blog site assignment from Tarun Sharma.

1 blog post is already there by default, however you can add new posts dynamically using Add Post Sagment in the last of the page .
It will require few things like 
1. Title of the Post.
2. Sub Title of the Post .
3. Image Of the Post (By default 3 images are available there in the project itself with names 1,2 and 3 you just need to add file name suppose if i want to use 2.jpg then i have to give image name as 2)
4. Description of the Post.
